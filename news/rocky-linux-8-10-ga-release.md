We are excited to announce the general availability of Rocky Linux 8.10. This release is now available for the x86_64 and aarch64 architectures. Please consult the release notes on the [Rocky Linux Documentation](https://docs.rockylinux.org/release_notes/8_10) for important information, including known issues and detailed changes in this version.

## Highlights

### Notable New Features and Changes

- Since Rocky Linux 8.9, Azure images are published under the new publisher name: `resf`, moving away from the earlier, less intuitive name.

* In addition to the Azure Marketplace, Rocky Linux is available for free on the Azure Community Gallery, providing incredibly easy access to run Rocky on Microsoft Azure. Instructions on how to utilize the Community Gallery images can be found on this [news post](https://rockylinux.org/news/rocky-on-azure-community-gallery/).

For a thorough list of updates and changes, refer to the [Rocky Linux 8.10 Release Notes](https://docs.rockylinux.org/release_notes/8_10).

### Special Interest Group Notes

- AWS images should now be able to boot in IPv6-only subnets, closing a [longstanding bug](https://bugs.rockylinux.org/view.php?id=279) that the Cloud SIG has worked with upstream to resolve
- While images for Rocky 9.4 were built with kiwi, Rocky Linux 8 images were built using the tooling that was used for past releases to ensure a smooth release artifact experience for the final minor release of 8.

### Release Engineering Notes

- This is the final minor release for the Rocky Linux 8.10--there will not be a Rocky Linux 8.11 in November. Instead, Rocky Linux 8 will receive security updates only for the next 5 years, in line with upstream’s life cycle. For more information, please see our [version guide](https://wiki.rockylinux.org/rocky/version/).

### Testing

Each Rocky Linux release undergoes extensive testing for accuracy and stability, incorporating both manual and automated checks across various environments and setups.

Rocky Linux 8.10 has been rigorously tested for a week before getting the final nod. Testing artifacts, discussions, and the release checklist are available [here](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/rocky-release-v810).

We welcome those interested in the release process to connect with the team at [chat.rockylinux.org](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/testing).

## Upgrades and Conversions

Existing Rocky Linux 8 users can update to version 8.10 using `dnf update` through the terminal or via desktop tools like GNOME Software, KDE Discover, etc.

Users from other Enterprise Linux 8 based distributions can transition to Rocky Linux 8.10 using the [migrate2rocky](https://github.com/rocky-linux/rocky-tools/blob/main/migrate2rocky/migrate2rocky.sh) script.
