# Rocky Linux is Optimized for Hacktoberfest

It’s October, which means we are in the season of Hacktoberfest! Hosted by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), this month-long event supports open source community health by encouraging contributions to GitHub- and GitLab-hosted public repositories. We celebrate the vision that led to this program. Last year more than 98,000 people participated; it’s exciting to think of the greater open source community receiving potentially almost 400,000 additions, modifications, and upgrades to existing content!

If you are a Hacktober participant, looking for a specific project to support, [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org) is hosted on GitHub! This means you can receive credit for contributing to our project. We would be happy to have you.

You’ll find a variety of open issues that outline needs from the Documentation, Web, and Wiki (community) repositories. These needs include desired tutorials; a new feature for our website; using a template to initialize document reports for past events; and some opportunities for social media posting.

The relevant repos and issues are tagged, but original ideas are also welcome. If you have something else you’d like to contribute via PR, let’s talk about it.

## To get started:

1. Register for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
2. Read our [Code of Conduct](https://rockylinux.org/about/coc).
3.
