The Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) today announced that it has joined the growing list of Open Source organizations to officially endorse the UN Open Source Principles. The UN Open Source Principles, recently adopted by the [UN Chief Executive Board’s Digital Technology Network (DTN)](https://unsceb.org/), provide guidelines to drive collaboration and Open Source adoption within the UN and globally.

The UN Open Source Principles are comprised of eight guidelines and provide a framework to guide the use, development and sharing of Open Source software across the organization:

1. **Open by default:** Making Open Source the standard approach for projects
2. **Contribute back:** Encouraging active participation in the Open Source ecosystem
3. **Secure by design:** Making security a priority in all software projects
4. **Foster inclusive participation and community building:** Enabling and facilitating diverse and inclusive contributions
5. **Design for reusability:** Designing projects to be interoperable across various platforms and ecosystems
6. **Provide documentation:** Providing thorough documentation for end-users, integrators and developers
7. **RISE (recognize, incentivize, support and empower):** Empowering individuals and communities to actively participate
8. **Sustain and scale:** Supporting the development of solutions that meet the evolving needs of the UN system and beyond.

> The Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation wholeheartedly endorses the UN Open Source Principles. These guidelines resonate deeply with our mission to ensure the longevity and free availability of enterprise-class Open Source software to all. We are proud to support the principles and eager to see them adopted more widely to promote a more collaborative and equitable digital future. - Brian Clemens, RESF Vice President
