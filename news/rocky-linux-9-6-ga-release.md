## Testing

Every Rocky Linux release undergoes thorough testing for accuracy and stability, and Rocky Linux 9.6 is no exception. The Rocky Linux testing process incorporates manual and automated checks across a wide variety of environments and setups. We have validated this release for a week before approving it for availability. Testing artifacts, discussions, and the release checklist can be found in the [Rocky Release (v9.6) Playbook](https://chat.rockylinux.org/playbooks/runs/gquiu1j3gidqpph68jifnmffcc).

To participate in this testing process for future releases, join the [~Testing channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/testing) on the [Rocky Linux Mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org/). We can’t wait to meet you!

## Upgrade and Conversion Process

You may upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.6 on the CLI by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`, or via desktop tools like GNOME Software or KDE Discover.

Users from other Enterprise Linux 9 based distributions may convert their installations to Rocky Linux 9.6 using the [migrate2rocky](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/migrate2rocky/) utilities.

Rocky Linux 9 does not offer an official upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend users of Rocky Linux 8 who wish to upgrade to Rocky Linux 9 do so via a fresh install.

## Known Issues

- **Current ZFS module will not load** - The currently released `zfs` module from OpenZFS **will not load** on Rocky Linux 9.6. For those using `zfs` on 9.5 and planning to upgrade to 9.6, you should hold off for now. If you are planning a fresh install of 9.6 and use `zfs` then again, you should wait for the release of the updated module. You can follow the issue [here](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17332) and [here](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/17364).
- **SELinux issue on hosts with `passt` installed** - When using a workstation, server, or virtual host with a `passt` back end installed, the interface will fail to start if SELinux is enabled. See [this upstream issue](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-80407) for more information.

For a more complete list and explanation of known issues, please see the [Rocky Linux 9.6 Release Notes](https://docs.rockylinux.org/release_notes/9_6/).
