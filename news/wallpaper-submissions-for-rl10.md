Greetings everyone, I'm Alexia, your Community Manager. In this opportunity, I'd like to encourage you all to participate in creating wallpapers and 
backgrounds for our upcoming release of Rocky Linux 10.

As a community-driven project, we'd love to see your artwork become part of our upcoming release. If you're interested in participating, click here to visit 
the forum thread where you can read the simple guidelines and upload your artwork.

Our team of caffeine-fueled, open-source-loving nerds (also known as the Community Team) will review and select some (or most!) of the submissions. Then, you 
can brag to everyone that you contributed to the development of this beautiful operating system.

So, head out to [Our Forum Thread](https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/rocky-linux-10-wallpaper-contest/17501) and start participating!
Don't forget to spread the word to your friends and colleagues who might be interested in participating.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop by our chat channel (#social) at [chat.rockylinux.org](https://chat.rockylinux.org) and come chat with us. We're 
happy to answer all your questions.

Bye for now!
