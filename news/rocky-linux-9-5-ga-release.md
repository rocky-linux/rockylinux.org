## Testing

Every Rocky Linux release undergoes thorough testing for accuracy and stability, and Rocky Linux 9.5 is no exception. The Rocky Linux testing process incorporates manual and automated checks across a wide variety of environments and setups. We have validated this release for a week before approving it for availability. Testing artifacts, discussions, and the release checklist can be found in the [Rocky Release (v9.5) Playbook](https://chat.rockylinux.org/playbooks/runs/cit8u75x17nkzyuog955fn3swa).

To participate in this testing process for future releases, join the [~Testing channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/testing) on the [Rocky Linux Mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org/). We can’t wait to meet you!

## Upgrade and Conversion Process

You may upgrade from Rocky Linux 9.x to Rocky Linux 9.5 on the CLI by running `sudo dnf -y upgrade`, or via desktop tools like GNOME Software or KDE Discover.

Users from other Enterprise Linux 9 based distributions may convert their installations to Rocky Linux 9.5 using the [migrate2rocky](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/migrate2rocky/) utilities.

Rocky Linux 9 does not offer an official upgrade path from any version of Rocky Linux 8. We recommend users of Rocky Linux 8 who wish to upgrade to Rocky Linux 9 do so via a fresh install.

## Known Issues

- **Anaconda** - Currently the help buttons when clicked in Anaconda may show blank pages in specific environments (eg. QEMU w/ virtio-vga).

For a more complete list and explanation of known issues, please see the [Rocky Linux 9.5 Release Notes](https://docs.rockylinux.org/release_notes/9_5/).
